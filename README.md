# Github Editor

A web base IDE, that uses github for storing data.

### Updates

10/20/18 #2: I added the rendering of HTML files, with the inclusion of javascript files loaded via src working :D

10/20/18 #1: I restarted developement using VueJS `<3` and Bootstrap. Hopefully I will have rending of HTML files and grabbing from Github working again soon. I have moved away from a weird files object with messy folder support to a virtual directory that uses nested objects for sub folders
